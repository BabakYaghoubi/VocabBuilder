The sqlite database is complete, and there are corresponding images and audio files for every reference in there. 

wordsdb.odb contains a formula which makes it slightly easier to enter all the filenames for new words, but then it should be saved as wordsdb.csv

Delete the current vocabulary.sqlite, then run csv2sqlite.R to regenerate the DB.
